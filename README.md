# MOZNLP
Mozambique NLP community

Mozambique is a linguistically rich country. About 42 languages are spoken in the country, but most of its languages are considered low-resourced.  Like most African languages, Mozambican languages are less represented in Natural Languages Processing (NLP) researches, mainly due to the unavailability of resources.
